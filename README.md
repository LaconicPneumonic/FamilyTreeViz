# FamilyTreeViz

I come from a really large family and for years my relatives and I have been trying to record our lineage. One of the things we struggled with was amassing and presenting this information in a way that was easy to update and share. I couldn't find any free or cheap services to do this on the web, so that's when I decide to do it myself.

## GOALS
- Individuals withing a family, regardless of technical ability, should be able to view their family tree in a simple way.
- A family should be able to host their app for free (within reason)

## DESIGN
